## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ Vite ](https://vitejs.dev/) - Build tool  


### What I learned

With this project I learned a little bit more of absolute positioning, in order to position the card images and filling 
the card data with the form inputs.


### Continued development

I'm planning to continue with trying other JavaScript frameworks like astro or svelte and working with public APIs.
